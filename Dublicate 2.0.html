5. How was the administration of the Ahom state-organized?<br>
Answer:<br>
Administration of Ahoms<br>
The Ahom state depended upon forced labour.<br>
The forced workers were called paiks.<br>
A census of the population was taken.<br>
Each village had to send a number of paiks by rotation<br>.
People from heavily populated areas were shifted to less populated places. — Ahom clans were thus broken up.<br>
By the first half of the seventeenth century, the administration became quite centralised.<br>
6. What changes took place in vama-based society?<br>
Answer: The following changes took place in uama-based society:<br>
Smaller castes or jatis emerged within vamas.<br>
On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis.<br>
Specialised artisans such as smiths, carpenters and masons were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.<br>
Jatis rather than vama became the basis for organising society.<br>
Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful.<br>
Many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society.<br>
Many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam. They continued to reject the caste-system.<br>
