On the other hand, many tribes and social groups were taken into caste-based society and given the status of jatis.
Specialised artisans such as smiths, carpenters and masons were also recognised as separate jatis by the Brahmanas.
Jatis rather than vama became the basis for organising society.
Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became powerful.
Many tribes became part of the caste system. But only the leading tribal families could join the ruling class. A large majority joined the lower jatis of caste society.
Many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam. They continued to reject the caste-system.
